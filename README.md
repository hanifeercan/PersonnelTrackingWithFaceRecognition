# Personnel Tracking With Face Recognition

This repository was prepared for my university graduation project. This project was awarded support under the 2023 second-term 2209-A - Research Project Support Programme for Undergraduate Students.
This project is connected to the [Face Recognition System](https://github.com/hanifeercan/FaceRecognitionSystem) repository.

This application, designed to facilitate personnel tracking, allows institutions or organizations to add new personnel to the system,
monitor entry and exit times, and perform real-time facial recognition.

This project is still under development.
